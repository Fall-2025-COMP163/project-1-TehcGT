# COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Chronicles
# 🎯 Project Overview

Build a text-based RPG character creation and story progression system that demonstrates mastery of functions and file I/O operations.

# Required Functions 
Complete these functions in project1_starter.py:

create_character(name, character_class) - Create new character

calculate_stats(character_class, level) - Calculate character stats

save_character(character, filename) - Save character to file

load_character(filename) - Load character from file

display_character(character) - Display character info

level_up(character) - Increase character level

# 🎭 Character Classes
Implement these character classes with unique stat distributions:


Warrior: High strength, low magic, high health

Mage: Low strength, high magic, medium health

Rogue: Medium strength, medium magic, low health

Cleric: Medium strength, high magic, high health

# 📁 Required File Format
Your save_character() function must create files in this exact format:

Character Name: [name]

Class: [class]

Level: [level]

Strength: [strength]

Magic: [magic]

Health: [health]

Gold: [gold]


# Run specific test file

# 🏆 Grading

Implementation (70%): Function correctness, file operations, error handling

Interview (30%): Code explanation and live coding challenge

The game is a high-fantasy RPG set in a world shattered by a magical cataclysm. The user is an adventurer choosing from 4 different archetypes which are, Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Cleric. This has players create these heroes to get their stats and save their progress. The core design was to give each class a different feeling like how the Warrior is a tank with a lot of health and the mage being a sorcerer with high magic. the simple scaling system was chosen so the class' unique base stats stay the most important thing. I used AI mainly to debug my code and find errors in my code to see why I was not passing the test case. CoPilot and Google Gemini were the main AI platforms I have been using.
